Basic terminology

Root Node :- The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In other words, the root node is the one which
doesn't have any parent.

Sub Tree :- If the root node is not null, the tree T1, T2 and T3 is called sub-trees of the root node.

Leaf Node :- The node of tree, which doesn't have any child node, is called leaf node. Leaf node is the bottom
most node of the tree. There can be any number of leaf nodes present in a general tree. Leaf nodes can also be
called external nodes.

Path :- The sequence of consecutive edges is called path. In the tree shown in the above image, path to the
node E is A→ B → E.

Ancestor node :- An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a path from root to that node. The root node 
doesn't have any ancestors. In the tree shown in the above image, the node F have the ancestors, B and A.

Degree :- Degree of a node is equal to number of children, a node have. In the tree shown in the above image, 
the degree of node B is 2. Degree of a leaf node is always 0 while in a complete binary tree, degree of each 
node is equal to 2.

Level Number :- Each node of the tree is assigned a level number in such a way that each node is present at 
one level higher than its parent. Root node of the tree is always present at level 0.
